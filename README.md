# Pathfinding Visualizer

This was a project made in middle school during a data structures class. This program visuzlizes different traversal algorithms, and allows the user to draw walls and mazes for the algorithm to search around. 
You can try to find and see the differences between different Algorithms likes Dijkstra's, A*, and BFS.
